QueryBuddy
QueryBuddy is a smart web-based chatbot system designed to streamline and simplify the college enquiry process.

Previously, students had to physically visit college campuses to obtain important information regarding course offerings, fee structures, admission procedures, and more. This traditional method was time-consuming and inconvenient.

QueryBuddy addresses these challenges by providing a fast, accurate, and user-friendly platform where students can easily get answers to their queries related to courses, admissions, eligibility, scholarships, and more â€” all without having to visit the campus.

Features
Instant Responses: Students can receive real-time answers to common queries.

Admin Dashboard: College staff can easily update or modify system responses.

Automated Enquiry Process: Reduces administrative workload significantly.

Real-Time Updates: Adapts to changing information and updates instantly.

Personalized Interaction: Delivers an interactive and customized experience to users.
